## Instructions

For Udacity FEND Nanodegree.

The following game is developed after a frogger game. The player wins the game once they reach the boat.

You may run the game either by cloning then opening the index.html or by opening this [link](https://rowam.github.io/Arcade-game-FEND/).

## How to play

The game is played by moving the hero up, down, left or right. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard.

You have to avoid the bugs and reach the boat to win. Either a collision with the bugs or water will set you back to initial position.
